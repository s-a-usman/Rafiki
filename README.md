This Arduino-based project incorporates a GPS module to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates, displayed in real-time on an OLED screen. The system allows user interaction through buttons for count increments and resets, showcasing the count on the display. Simultaneously, when both buttons are pressed, it checks for valid GPS data and, if available, triggers an SMS alert using a SIM800L GSM module, notifying a specified contact about potential danger along with the current location coordinates. The project effectively integrates GPS functionality, user interaction, display output, and an SMS alert system to create a comprehensive location-tracking and alert mechanism.
